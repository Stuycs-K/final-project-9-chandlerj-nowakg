Added an actual projectile sprite now that we're working with the green library. Also began to change projectiles, and created a new method that runs every frame within the projectile class, the zombie class, and the plant class.

Created the projectile class, and made 3 methods for said projectile class. I also worked on the zombie class, and added a new method to that. Depending on whether or not we use the green library, ill have to replace this stuff, but it's cool since I wrote it in a way that would make this pretty easy.
