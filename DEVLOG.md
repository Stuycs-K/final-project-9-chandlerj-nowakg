WORKING FEATURES
----------------------------
* Plant selection grid; You can drag and drop plants from the grid into your plant toolbar. You can also you can just click on the icons in the grid.
* Plants have Internal Cooldowns which dictate when they can fire. As the game runs at a locked 30fps, plants that shoot per second have an ICD of 30.
* The Shovel: Hold 'S' and Left-Click to delete a plant from the grid. This does not refund your sun.
* Sun economy- Plants cost sun, which falls from the sky at certain intervals. You can also obtain sun from Sunflowers, Twin Sunflowers, and Sunshrooms.
* If you don't have enough sun to purchase a plant, you will not be able to place it.
* Lawnmowers: When a zombie gets too close to the house, if a lawnmower is present, it will enter the "triggered" state, and run to the opposite end of the 	screen, killing any zombie in its path.
* Wave Spawner: Every so often, a wave of zombies will spawn in. As the number of waves cleared increases, the game becomes more difficult, and more powerful zombies will begin to spawn in higher numbers.
* Certain Zombies are rarer spawns than others: For example, the Yeti is much rarer than a normal zombie
* Zombies dropping currency at random on death (10% chance for a silver coin, 2% diamond, 2% money bag)
* Some plants, like the Cherry Bomb and Gatling Pea, have been modified past their original features in the game. This is NOT a bug.
* Certain projectiles hitting more than one Zombie before being destroyed. This includes the Cawb (cobCannon projectile), the Spike (Cactus Projectile), and
	the Spore (Fumeshroom and Puffshroom Projectile)

KNOWN BUGS
-----------------------------
* Plants will shoot regardless of whether or not a Zombie is in front of them
* Upon spawning upwards of 50 zombies at once, game begins to lag. Same applies to high fire-rate plants like the Gatling Pea.
* Only the Day Level is functional 
* Bungie Jumper Zombies don't move; They just kinda stay at the back of the world.
* Cherry Bomb actually costs 1500 sun as opposed to the 150 that the image displays. (Not a bug, as I wanted to do that, but it's something that you should be 	aware of)
*  (some plants dont work- less of a bug and more of the fact that we just didn't code the other plants)
