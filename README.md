## Instructions
This project is a knockoff of the popular mobile game, Plants Vs Zombies. While our version is much less polished, there are some things that we tried that would only be possible in processing. Our main file is Plants Vs Zombies; That’s where the game is run.The plants file as well as the zombies file work similarly to what you’d expect. In order to place plants, we make use of a 2D array which is constantly updated throughout the course of the game. We have a folder filled with sprites in this repo, as well. This project was made by Gaven Nowak and John Chandler!
